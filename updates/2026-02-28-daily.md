Here is what you missed while you were sleeping.

## The Big Thing
**OpenAI announced a $110B private round at a $730B pre-money valuation, with Amazon, Nvidia, and SoftBank anchoring the deal.**

Why it matters: this is not “startup funding news.” It is a signal that frontier AI is now an infrastructure arms race (compute commitments, cloud lock-in, and distribution partnerships), not just a model race.

- **US platform-policy risk is moving down-stack into the OS layer.** California’s age-verification requirement discussion is now surfacing direct compliance pressure on operating-system/account setup flows (including open-source distro ecosystems).

- **Markets are rewarding scale commitments but punishing execution uncertainty.** Mega-rounds and AI-capex enthusiasm remain intact, but sentiment is increasingly sensitive to infra utilization and policy shocks.
