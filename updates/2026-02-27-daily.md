Here is what you missed while you were sleeping.

## The Big Thing
**AI infrastructure funding snapped back hard in the last 24 hours, with multiple chip/physical-AI startups announcing fresh rounds.**

Why it matters: we are still in the “compute-first” phase. Capital is prioritizing the picks-and-shovels layer (chips, data infra, deployment tooling) over polished end-user apps.

## Tech Impact
- **US–China tech controls are mutating, not disappearing.** As policy pressure shifts, export controls and supply chains continue to dictate who gets frontier compute.

- **Rare-earth constraints are still a hard bottleneck** for aerospace + chip supply chains, even with temporary trade thaw headlines.

- **Market behavior remains concentrated in AI narratives** (especially Asia + semis), which keeps volatility asymmetric around policy and earnings cycles.
