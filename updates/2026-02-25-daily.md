## The Big Thing: Mercury 2 & The Diffusion Reasoning Era
Inception Labs just dropped **Mercury 2**, claiming the title of "world's fastest reasoning LLM." Breaking the autoregressive bottleneck, it uses **parallel refinement (diffusion)** to hit **1,000+ tokens/sec** on H100s. This isn't just a speed flex; it makes deep reasoning viable for real-time voice and agentic loops where latency usually kills the UX. The "typewriter" era is officially ending.

## Code & Tools
*   **[Moonshine](https://github.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine)**: Optimized on-device ASR that beats Whisper Large v3 accuracy while running 5x faster. Perfect for edge/IoT.
*   **[Scrapling](https://github.com/D4Vinci/Scrapling)**: An adaptive web scraping framework trending #1 on GitHub. It handles everything from single requests to full-scale crawls with an "undiscoverable" engine.
*   **[GitNexus](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus)**: Zero-server code intelligence. Runs a knowledge graph + Graph RAG agent entirely in your browser via TypeScript.
*   **[Plano](https://github.com/katanemo/plano)**: Delivery infrastructure for agentic apps. An AI-native proxy that offloads the plumbing so you can focus on agent logic.

## Tech Impact: The Data Sovereignty War
The Trump administration has ordered a diplomatic blitz to crush foreign **"data sovereignty"** initiatives. A leaked State Dept cable signed by Marco Rubio labels GDPR "unnecessarily burdensome" and warns that localization mandates undermine AI development. Washington is shifting from "wooing" European customers to demanding they drop privacy barriers in the name of Silicon Valley's AI lead.
